### Planning

- Agile approach:
Adopted an Agile approach to manage the project efficiently. This methodology allows for iterative development, continuous feedback, and flexibility to adapt to changes. By breaking the project into smaller, manageable tasks, we can deliver incremental improvements and ensure a high-quality end product.

- User Stories: 
User stories are a key component of our Agile approach. They describe the features and functionalities from the user's perspective, ensuring that the project meets the users' needs. Each user story includes acceptance criteria to define the conditions for successful implementation. This helps in maintaining a user-centric focus throughout the development process.

- Fonts

Urban Flow uses the Oswald font to provide a modern and clean aesthetic that complements the contemporary urban fashion showcased on the site. The Oswald font is known for its readability and style, enhancing the overall user experience by ensuring that all text elements are both visually appealing and easy to read.

- Colours

The color palette for Urban Flow consists of black, white, orange, and blue, creating a vibrant and dynamic visual identity. Each color plays a specific role in the design:

Black: Used for the background, providing a sleek and elegant contrast.

White: Serves as the primary colour for forms and tables, ensuring clarity and readability.

Orange: Accentuates call-to-action buttons and highlights, adding energy and a sense of urgency.

Blue: Adds a touch of cool sophistication and is used for links and interactive elements to guide user interactions.

## Deployment

Heroku was used to deploy the site, Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports several programming languages, including Python. Heroku simplifies the deployment process by providing a platform where you can easily manage your application's infrastructure, scaling, and monitoring without needing to worry about server management. I connected my app on Heroku to my repository on Github, configured environment variables in the Config Vars section and created a Procfile. I set up AWS for serving static files and installed the required packages boto3 and django-storages then updated my settings file for deployment. Automatic deploys was set up on Heroku so every time I made a change to the code in Github, committed and pushed the files the change would take effect on the deployed site.

## SEO
